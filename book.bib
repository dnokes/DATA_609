abstract = { We propose a dynamic model for the high/low range of asset prices within fixed time intervals: the Conditional Autoregressive Range Model (henceforth CARR). The evolution of the conditional range is specified in a fashion similar to the conditional variance models as in GARCH and is very similar to the Autoregressive Conditional Duration (ACD) model of Engle and Russell (1998). Extreme value theories imply that the range is an efficient estimator of the local volatility, e.g., Parkinson (1980). Hence, CARR can be viewed as a model of volatility. Out-of-sample volatility forecasts using the S&P500 index data show that the CARR model does provide sharper volatility estimates compared with a standard GARCH model.},

It is proved by the empirical analysis that the DSTCC-CARR model is more credible and efficient than the DSTCC-GARCH model.

               desire for parsimonious models of economic phenomena that take
               human reasoning into account. This approach has been the
               cornerstone of modern economic theory. We explain why this is
               so, extolling the virtues of equilibrium theory; then we present
               a critique and describe why this approach is inherently limited,
               and why economics needs to move in new directions if it is to
               continue to make progress. We stress that this shouldn't be a
               question of dogma, and should be resolved empirically. There are
               situations where equilibrium models provide useful predictions
               and there are situations where they can never provide useful
               predictions. There are also many situations where the jury is
               still out, i.e., where so far they fail to provide a good
               description of the world, but where proper extensions might
               change this. Our goal is to convince the skeptics that
               equilibrium models can be useful, but also to make traditional
               economists more aware of the limitations of equilibrium models.
               We sketch some alternative approaches and discuss why they
               should play an important role in future research in economics.

               started as a bet about whether great traders were born or made
               became a legendary trading experiment that, until now, has never
               been told in its entirety. Way of the Turtle reveals, for the
               first time, the reasons for the success of the secretive trading
               system used by the group known as the ``Turtles.'' Top-earning
               Turtle Curtis Faith lays bare the entire experiment, explaining
               how it was possible for Dennis and Eckhardt to recruit 23
               ordinary people from all walks of life and train them to be
               extraordinary traders in just two weeks. Only nineteen years old
               at the time-the youngest Turtle by far-Faith traded the largest
               account, making more than $30 million in just over four years.
               He takes you behind the scenes of the Turtle selection process
               and behind closed doors where the Turtles learned the lucrative
               trading strategies that enabled them to earn an average return
               of over 80 percent per year and profits of more than $100
               million. You'll discover How the Turtles made money-the
               principles that guided their trading and the step-by-step
               methods they followed Why, even though they used the same
               approach, some Turtles were more successful than others How to
               look beyond the rules as the Turtles implemented them to find
               core strategies that work for any tradable market How to apply

  abstract  = "In practical applications of Box-Jenkins autoregressive
               integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, the number of times
               that the observed time series must be differenced to achieve
               approximate stationarity is usually determined by careful, but
               mostly informal, analysis of the differenced series. For many
               time series, some differencing seems appropriate, but taking the
               first or the second difference may be too strong. As an
               alternative, Hosking, and Granger and Joyeux proposed the use of
               fractional differences. For \$-\frac\{1\}\{2\} , the resulting
               fractional ARIMA processes are stationary. For \$0 , the
               correlations are not summable. The parameter d can be estimated,
               for instance by maximum likelihood. Unfortunately, estimation
               methods known so far have been restricted to the stationary
               range \$-\frac\{1\}\{2\} . In this paper, we show how any real
               \$d > -\textbackslashfrac\{1\}\{2\}\$ can be estimated by an
               approximate maximum likelihood method. We thus obtain a unified
               approach to fitting traditional Box-Jenkins ARIMA processes as
               well as stationary and non-stationary fractional ARIMA
               processes. A confidence interval for d can be given. Tests, such
               as for unit roots in the autoregressive parameter or for
               stationarity, follow immediately. The resulting confidence
               intervals for the ARIMA parameters take into account the
               additional uncertainty due to estimation of d. A simple
               algorithm for calculating the estimate of d and the ARMA
               parameters is given. Simulations and two data examples
               illustrate the results.",

  abstract  = "Volatility of the underlying asset is a critical input to modern
               option pricing models. How to get the best volatility estimate
               is, therefore, a matter of great importance to options traders.
               One technique that has been known for a long time, although it
               is less commonly used, involves not just daily closing prices,
               but the daily high and low. This actually introduces quite a bit
               more information into the calculation, since the high and low
               are functions of the entire intraday price path for the
               underlying, not just the price at a single point in time. In
               contrast, models that allow volatility to vary over time,
               notably GARCH, have become popular as a way to capture
               time-variation in the volatility process. This article
               introduces a GARCH-type Multiplicative Error Model (MEM) for the
               daily price range. Like other GARCH specifications, the MEM can
               be modified to accommodate different densities for the
               stochastic shocks, different orders of dependence on past shocks
               and volatilities, and even fractional integration to produce a
               long-memory process. The authors fit the model to the daily
               price ranges for the CHF/USD and USD/GBP exchange rates and show
               it to be quite effective in producing accurate (and profitable)
               volatility predictions.",

               the conditional range is specified in a fashion similar to the

               the Autoregressive Conditional Duration (ACD) model of Engle and
               Russell (1998). Extreme value theories imply that the range is
               an efficient estimator of the local volatility, e.g., Parkinson
               (1980). Hence, CARR can be viewed as a model of volatility.
               Out-of-sample volatility forecasts using the S\&P500 index data
               show that the CARR model does provide sharper volatility
               estimates compared with a standard GARCH model.",
